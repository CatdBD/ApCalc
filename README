A program to compute exactly what fraction of an
array of pixels falls inside a circular aperture.

Call as:
circ_app.circular_aperture(arrs, circle_loc, rcirc, normalize=True, plot=False, plot_marker_size=5000)

Inputs:
- arrs: Tuple of x and y indexes (from np.meshgrid)
- circle_loc: Tuple containing the x and y coordinate of the
centre of the circle (in pixel units)
- rcirc: The radius fo the circle (in pixel units)
kwargs:
- normalize - if true, the fraction of each pixel inside or outside the
circle is returned. Otherwise, the area is returned. Default is True.
 - plot - if True an image is produced which shows the fractions of each pixel
 inside the aperture. Default is False.
 - plot_marker_size - determines the marker size used in the optional plot.

Returns:
- all_x: The x-coordinates of the pixels in a 1-D list
- all_y: The y-coordinates of the pixels in a 1-D list
- all_A: The Area or fraction of each pixel falling inside the aperture
